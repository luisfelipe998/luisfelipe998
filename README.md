## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is LuÃ­s Felipe and I'm a backend software developer since 2019 based in Brazil. 

I have experience working on all the lifecycle of cloud based applications running on kubernetes in several different languages, such as Golang, Typescript (Node.js), Python and Java.
I really care about delivering the most value to the customers, software design and best code & deploy practices. I'm passioned about technology and I'm always looking to learn something new.
